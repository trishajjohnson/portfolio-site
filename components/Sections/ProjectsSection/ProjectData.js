                was difficult for me to define.  It wasn't a hard skill like fixing a car or building a house.  The truth is, I've 
                used it every single day since. The majority of my work experience has been in the service industry, 5 years of which 
                were spent making and serving coffee to the public, and that experience has taught me a very valuable lesson.  Sometimes, I was the 
                first human interaction a customer had in their day and I realized what a powerful position that was to be in.  I had 
                the ability to influence the trajectory of someone's day, simply by greeting them with a warm smile and a killer cup of joe!`,

                professionally.  Understanding why people are the way they are and what motivates them gives you a great deal of power and influence.  
                With this deeper insight, you have the chance of making a difference.  Working in the service industry has taught me that the success 
                of a business does not depend solely on the value of the product or service it provides.  A business will not thrive simply because 
                it has a solid business plan.  Its success can only be measured in comparison to the satisfaction of its customer base.  Bridging 
                the two requires adaptability, and that, in my opinion, is the key to success.`,
